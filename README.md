# Bayesian Multilevel Model â€“ Group Project

## Overview

This project was completed as part of the **Bayesian Multilevel Models** course.  
The objective was to apply **Bayesian multilevel modeling** using the `brms` package in R to a clustered dataset.

## Objectives
- Selecting and exploring a dataset with a meaningful grouping structure
- Formulating a clear research question
- Fitting multiple multilevel Bayesian models using `brms`
- Performing:
  - Prior sensitivity analysis
  - Posterior predictive checks
  - Model comparison
- Interpreting key parameters in the context of the research question


## Contributions

My contribution includes dataset selection, Model 4 feature selection and implementation in Sections 2 - 5, and Section 6 Interpretation of parameters
